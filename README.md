# Python Regex Extraction Project

Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the power of regular expressions (regex) in extracting structured data from unstructured text. The examples focus on real-world use cases such as:
- Extracting Twitter handles from text
- Identifying risk types in financial statements
- Finding phone numbers in documents
- Parsing fiscal year periods (quarterly and semi-annual)
- Extracting financial figures (monetary values) from reports
- Retrieving section titles from structured text Features

Uses **Python's re module** to efficiently extract patterns from text
Provides real-world examples from financial documents, social media links, and reports
Demonstrates various regex techniques including:
- Capturing groups
- Lookaheads and lookbehinds
- Character classes
- Non-capturing groups
- Files in this Repository

### practice_2.ipynb: Contains exercises on extracting Twitter handles, financial risk types, and fiscal year periods.
### regex_2.ipynb: Demonstrates regex applications for extracting phone numbers, financial report details, and structured sectionÂ headings.
